# project-management-frameworks
This repository contains templates, workflows, and practical tools I use as a Project Manager. All materials are adapted for small, fast-growing tech teams that need clarity, structure, and lightweight governance.

## What's inside

### Templates
Reusable documents for planning, alignment, and team execution:
- Project Charter  
- RACI Matrix  
- Risk Log  
- Retrospective Template  
- Sprint Planning Structure  

### Workflows
Frameworks and operational systems:
- Agile sprint lifecycle  
- Jira workflow examples  
- PMO governance routines  
- Decision log process  

These resources represent how I approach delivery, prioritization, and organizational clarity—without any confidential information from my current or past roles.
