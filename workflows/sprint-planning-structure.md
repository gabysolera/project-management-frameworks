# **Sprint Planning** - A lightweight, end-to-end process for predictable delivery in small technical teams 

## 1. Purpose of the Framework
This system ensures that each sprint is:
- Anchored in real performance data  
- Grounded in the team’s actual capacity  
- Structured around clear priorities and sequencing  
- Supported by well-defined expectations (Ready and Done)  
- Protected from recurring issues and rework  

The goal is predictable delivery through clarity, _not ceremony._

## 2. Inputs to the Process

Below is a structured view of the inputs needed to begin the sprint framework, what each input provides, and the decisions it enables.

| Input category | What we extract | Decisions it supports |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Sprint performance data | Patterns, carryover causes, reopens, quality failures, cycle time indicators | Capacity planning, process adjustments, risk focus, Ready/Done refinement |
| Team capacity snapshot | Real availability, constraints, workload distribution | How much we can commit, allocation per person, whether to de-scope |
| Upcoming milestones | Deadlines, sequencing constraints, client expectations | Sprint goal creation, prioritization order, must-have items |
| Backlog readiness | Stories ready for commitment, refinement needs, technical debt items | Final sprint scope, what enters vs stays out, refinement tasks |

These inputs allow effective planning before any team discussion takes place.

## 3. Pre-Planning (PM analytical phase)

This is the core of the process and happens independently of the team.

### Analysis of previous sprint
- Identification of performance patterns  
- Root causes of carryover, reopens, or quality issues  
- Chronic blockers or recurring dependency failures   

### Team capacity assessment
- Actual availability  
- Workload distribution  
- Known blockers  
- Time allocations for support or incidents  

### Drafting the sprint proposal
- Preliminary list of pending items  
- Technical sequencing order  
- Items that depend on external factors  
- Stories not ready for commitment  
- Initial risk assessment  

### Risk Identification
- Missing data or unclear inputs  
- Access to critical systems   
- ML or data dependencies  
- Handoff issues across teams  
- Rework risks

## 4. Technical validation with Leads

Before the team session, the PM validates:

- Whether the proposed sequence is technically sound  
- Whether dependencies are ready  
- Whether any stories require splitting  
- Whether risk mitigation is possible  
- Expected complexity or unknowns  

This avoids lengthy discussions during the group session.

## 5. Sprint Session (Validation and alignment point)

The meeting is not the core process; it is only the alignment checkpoint.

### Activities during the session
1. Present the diagnostic, not just metrics  
2. Confirm the sprint goal  
3. Align on priorities  
4. Validate stories for clarity  
5. Estimate relative effort  
6. Confirm capacity vs commitments  
7. Document risks for the sprint  
8. Align on Ready and Done expectations  

This is the final moment to confirm the sprint, not to plan it from scratch.

---

## 6. Outputs of the process

Regardless of the meeting, the framework must produce:

- A confirmed Sprint scope  
- A transparent capacity vs load assessment  
- Documented sprint risks  
- Actions to prevent recurrence of previous issues  
- Defined expectations for Ready and Done  
- Updated documentation if needed  

---

## 7. Execution monitoring during the Sprint

Key practices include:

### Blocker scanning
The PM identifies potential blockers before the daily meeting and prepares context.

### Flow validation
Ensure that work progresses smoothly across stages such as:  
Example: SE → Dev → SE → ML → QA 

### Reinforcement of desired behaviors
Highlight clarity, documentation discipline, and reduced rework as recurring goals.

---

## 8. Close-of-Sprint activities

Before starting the next cycle, the PM performs:

### Data consolidation
- Key metrics  
- Observed patterns  
- Quality issues  
- Delivery gaps  

### Diagnostic summary
Internal PM reflection on what must be addressed next sprint.

### Backlog adjustment
Stories are moved, refined, or reprioritized based on findings.

### Improvement capture
Document 1–2 improvement items to apply immediately in the next cycle.

## 9. Why this framework works

This process creates predictable delivery by:

- Anchoring decisions in real performance  
- Reducing meetings to what is necessary  
- Ensuring clarity before work begins  
- Making risks visible early  
- Reducing rework through structured expectations  
- Increasing the team’s capacity to self-organize effectively  

It provides structure without bureaucracy, ideal for small, high-velocity teams.
